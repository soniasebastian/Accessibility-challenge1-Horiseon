# Accessibility-challenge1-Horiseon
In this challenge assignment I am trying to Improve the accessibility standards in order to get the website optimized for search engines.The source code is given and certain changes are made to make the website more effiecient with Git, semantic HTML elements and styling in a sequential order.
## Description
A webpage http://127.0.0.1:5501/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Develop/index.html is the one that i am working with.Here I am just refactoring the existing code to ensure that the people with disabilities can access this website more easily and avoid litigation.
Accesibility includes complex criteria but based on specific criteria given below in acceptance criteria necessary alterations are being made.I am really interested in working with the sequencing of HTML elements and CSS styling and thus making it much more compatible and accessible so that people with disabilities can easily get through it.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the alterations made for making the website more accessible.The screenshots have been provided in the repository.
